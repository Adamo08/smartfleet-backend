-- Script to fix all hard-coded IDs in V24 migration
-- This script contains the patterns to replace all hard-coded IDs with proper subqueries

-- The main issue is that the vehicles INSERT statements use hard-coded IDs like:
-- , 7, 6, 75)  -- category_id, brand_id, model_id

-- These need to be replaced with subqueries like:
-- , (SELECT id FROM vehicle_categories WHERE name = 'SUV'), 
--   (SELECT id FROM vehicle_brands WHERE name = 'Toyota'), 
--   (SELECT id FROM vehicle_models WHERE name = 'RAV4' AND brand_id = (SELECT id FROM vehicle_brands WHERE name = 'Toyota')))

-- Key mappings based on the data:
-- Category IDs: 6=Hatchback, 7=SUV, 9=Truck, 12=Luxury, 16=Electric, 21=Off-Road, 23=Minivan, 24=Crossover, 26=Muscle Car, 27=Luxury SUV, 28=Super SUV
-- Brand IDs: 6=Toyota, 7=Volkswagen, 8=BMW, 9=Ford, 10=Honda, 11=Hyundai, 12=Mercedes-Benz, 13=Porsche, 14=Nissan, 15=Kia, 16=Audi, 17=Tata Motors, 18=Tesla

-- The migration should work now with the vehicle_models fixes applied.
-- The remaining vehicle entries can be fixed by replacing the hard-coded IDs with the appropriate subqueries.
